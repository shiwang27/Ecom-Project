# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

A robust and scalable backend service for a modern e-commerce web application. This project focuses on the server-side logic, including REST API development, business logic implementation, and database management.

**Note:** The primary focus of this repository is the backend development. The frontend, built with React, was sourced from [telusko] and is used here for demonstration purposes.(https://github.com/navinreddy20/ecom-frontend-1)].
